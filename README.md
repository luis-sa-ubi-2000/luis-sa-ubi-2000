## Hi there, welcome to my repository of projects done until now! ðŸ‘‹

#### I took the Specialist Technician course in Information Systems Technologies and Programming at ATEC in 2019. I interned and worked at Indra as a Programming Technician from September 2019 to February 2020. I completed a Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering at the University of Beira Interior and collaborated in the junior company STAR JE as a Web Developer.
